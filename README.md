# A data  analysis Project using Python and Tableau. [Click here](#) for the full article.
The stack overflow survey is an annual survey that examines all aspects of a developers’ experience such as favorite technologies, work preferences, career satisfaction and education background. With nearly 60K responses from more than 170 countries. The analysis was carried out using python and python libraries such as NumPy and pandas to get the desired data by doing altercation and manipulation on the data, GEOPY for location geocoding, seaborn and matplotlib for visualization and also made uses of other built in library as shown in my Jupiter Notebook. 

In the Jupyter Notebook, you will leearn how I carried out the following steps for the project:
  1. Import library
  2. Import data set
  3. Data cleaning
  4. Data exploration
  5. Model development

#REMARK
Some of the insights I generated are stated below:
     Based on the demographics of the survey respondents, we can infer that the survey is somewhat representative of the      overall programming community, although it definitely has fewer responses from programmers who are women & non-          binary genders.
     
     Most programmers hold a college degree, although a fairly large percentage did not have computer science as their        major in college, so a computer science degree isn’t compulsory for learning to code or building a career in       programming
